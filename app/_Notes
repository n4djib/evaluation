- 

== Note ==
----------------

	- write good tests like the ones in the configuration which show errors
	- watch how people use the application
       to find out how you can make the application UX better
	- Write things you Note missing in the App


== PRIORITY 1 ==

	- in Result and Bultin 
		be carefull of the source of the data (semester vs ratt)
	- remove session from Annual

		make the decision in Progrission and Classement
		if it i filled it changes what in AnnualGrade
	- in classement-laurieate
		give the option to consider saved students as rattrapage


- TAGS FOR EXAM SURVIORS
	https://www.cssscript.com/tags-input-tagplug/
	https://www.phpzag.com/create-bootstrap-tags-input-with-jquery-php-mysql/
	https://www.phpzag.com/demo/create-bootstrap-tags-input-with-jquery-php-mysql/
	in Module_Session Config 
		make Exam Surveyors with Tagging
		https://bootstrap-tagsinput.github.io/bootstrap-tagsinput/examples/
		https://select2.org/selections
	- module config - add datepicker - and Tag exam surviyors





- WARNING: if SF average is under 10 in a semester 
	that does not mean necisseraly it will enter RATT.
- WARNING : when i don't fill Rattrapage
	and then calculate annual - some inconsistencies appear
- WARNING:
	when i duplicate the Semester
	is the Modules duplicated too ??????
		yes modules are duplicated
		and this causes problems
			i have to treet Config as a String
- WARNING : add/remove Student order in Chrome








- add Tasks(TODO list) as notification
	make Home Page a todo List
- deleting rattrapage is deleting even when connected to annual
	change it later in  def delete_session(session_id):
	and session.html {{' s' if module.is_savable == True}}






-- ANNUAL:
    - classement in annual
	- When Creating a new Annual
		ask for Reinit/Recalculate
	- lock annual
		maybe no need because you calculate all the time
		and maybe lock it to not allow recalculating 
	- lock historic grid
	- lock semestr Historic
	- lockout login after many failed attempts
		- brut force pass cracking
	- find a way to allow registration
		enable & disabled Users
	- in Tree check annual session need to caclulate
	- in calculating Annual Average
		i have to put a finalAverage column
		and be carfull when printing Bulting
			give the option of printing before Rattrapage
	add create annual link to tree





- use server workers for offline use
- add a cron job to save database








- add macros to represent datetime
	http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/#macros
	import
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19002290/how-to-use-macros-in-a-included-file
	Custom widgets
		https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/stable/widgets.html

- remove Notes from the Pages
- Combine check_grades_status & get_icon_progress
	??????????????
- use tabs to organize students
	in students List
- use tabs to organize tree each school
- add param to functions that have 
	db.session.commit()
	(self, commit=True):
		if commit==True:
			db.session.commit()
- use is_dirty to optimize calculation time

- add "no-validate" attribute to each form using javascript/jquery, like this: 
	$(document).ready(function() {
	    $("form").attr('novalidate', 'novalidate');
	});







- NOTE in module config it calculates when i change save_enabled
	add redirect page for a better UX



- calculate average from Saving
- fix cursor when it is open
- Scanner
	https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/OpenPaperwork/libinsane#readme
	https://doc.openpaper.work/libinsane/latest/libinsane/index.html





- use letters to navigate the grid rather than arrows


-- make the navigation easier
	show Semester Average & Annual Average
	between semesters
	from semester result to Module Grid
	from annual to grids
	and from ratt
	- add a button to navigate between a session(semester) and its ratt
	and the notion of URL_RETURN
		you can add a flash of url_return







- check in routesCalculation
	calculate_all(session):
	calculate_student(session, student):
	same for init

- Note: in session calculate check
    # grades = grade_unit.grades
    grades = Grade.query.filter_by(
        student_session_id=grade_unit.student_session_id
        ).all()
    - form error messages in quickform is different than you use the fields
		like in Promo
- flask static
	and upload automaticaly to github
	try to include the javascript
- deactivate a student rather than deleting him
- indicate that a semestral ratt is passing in annual for SF
- maybe when i reintialize the ids change
	when removing a student
- in GradeUnit what is the purpose of unit_coefficient
	used in init_grade_unit --- grade_unit.unit_coefficient = unit.unit_coefficient
	& is_fondamental
		i think i added them for Historic Config



- add sort to annual
- add sorter in UEF unit
- indecate the need to calculate in Annual
- duplicate Semester from FlaskAdmin

- upload files to a free Static website
- add filter to rattrapage
- 
- what about the students who need to pass some modules (avec dette)


- IDEA: in grade grid
	when you change set to dirty and send only dirty fields
		this will allow parallel editing

- add double saisier notion
	meaning two agents enter data twice to make sure everything is correct
	maybe no need for it if the student can check by himself


== PRINTABLES ==
----------------
				- bultin annual normal + rattrapage
				- print bultin is showing None in birth date
				- Bultin Semester Header
				- Bultin Average & credit & session
				- finish the 3 printables first
					bultin header + annual + ratt
					and the choice between the two sessions
					print From Annual Page
					and module header
				- when printing XPS & PDF
					name the file with a date
				- classement in resultat
				- add the headers and footers for the printables
				- change "name" to "display_name" in printables 
	- all Printables in one PDF of a Session | Annual | Promo 
		for all or for one Student
	- in printables Title and header 
		be carfull of Semester|ratt
	- one PDF contains all Annual Printables
	- one PDF contains all Semester Printables
	- add print : list of rattrapage without modules to pass
	- Ratt list by module
	- add last_modification to printables
		last entry in the database tables Grade
	- add Thumbnail to Preview print
	- check module printables
	- print Module list
		if there is any grades, show new other buttons
	- Annual Result
	- print Annual (sem1 + sem2 + ratt)
	- print Zerbia (Ratt + normal)
		and show session 1 or 2
	
	- make check_grid_is_complite() universal in routesSession.py
		pass grades and check them
	- add diolog box to print Module to choose
	- annual bultin would not display correctly
		if the initializition is not updated (rattrapage and normal)
	- in Result Be carful of long Module Names
	- in Result Print Browser the tables print wrong if it jumps to the next Page

	- Rattrapage printables
	- annual Ratt print must show only when there is two semesters
	- a location to print all Printables
	- you have to show session (normal or ratt) in printables
		result & bultin
	- finish Progrission Etat






-- Refactoring
	- move annual functions from Semester to Annual
		like get_annual_chain
	- in FORM SelectField should filter 
	- when you transfer students to the next year
		they have to qualify
		transfaire from annual, not from semester
		Only Admit & Admit avec dette
	- use Count() in sqlalchemy
	- globlize the changing lists like ['cour', 'td', 'tp', 't_pers', 'stage', 'saving_grade']
		to avoid changing them in many places
	- 


-- Potencial Bugs ==
	- 
	- 




- finish permissions to allow multi-user-entering of Historic

	2 - collect data from History
		give the choice between keeping entered data or crushing it

	and configurable
	in SF if i generate RATT from annual
		it will show students that should not enter RATT
		it can happen in ISP if ratt 2
			you have to take into considiration that the semester is passed
	check every student Annual
	and take into consideration Branch+Annual
