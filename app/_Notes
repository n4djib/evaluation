== ERRORS ==
------------
						- an error happens when i try to create a Annual Session
						- studetn is not saving birth place 
						- and i have to not enforce la Wilaya
						- in Update Massive
							the Wilaya "El Taref" is not bieng saved
								because "El Taref " has a space
- in create many students
	wilaya dropdown is not working when i use the keyboard
-  Button create-rattrapage annual is not working
	http://localhost:5000/annual-session/1/rattrapage/
- if an SF student has Average of 10 and credit < 60
	does she pass the rattrapage in non Fonamental Modules
	there is not point in repassing them
- 
- 
- 

== QUESTIONS ==
---------------

	ask Sabah and Sahel about the required Printables
- Rattrapage printables
- 
-

== PRINTABLES ==
----------------
- a location to print all Printables
- you have to show session(normal or ratt) in printables
	result & bultin
- in result header
	on the left is centering
- in Result and Bultin 
	be carefull of the source of the data (semester vs ratt)
- semester Result in fire firefox is skiping the first page
- Don't forget to Comment 
	get_semester_result_data in routesSession.py
- when printing XPS & PDF
	name the file with a date
- print Module list
	if there is any grades, show new other buttons
- Annual Result
- 

Note: when you program
	make the function with a good name then start to implement it
	like: check if configuration_changed(session_id):

	write good tests like the ones in the configuration which show errors
