	ask Sabah and Sahel about the required Printables
- Rattrapage printables
- doublage ????
- if there is no Cour, how deos the student pass the ratt
- 

== PRINTABLES ==
----------------
- a location to print all Printables
- you have to show session(normal or ratt) in printables
	result & bultin
- in result header
	on the left is centering
- in Result and Bultin 
	be carefull of the source of the data (semester vs ratt)
- semester Result in fire firefox is skiping the first page
- Don't forget to Comment 
	get_semester_result_data in routesSession.py
- when printing XPS & PDF
	name the file with a date
- print Module list
	if there is any grades, show new other buttons

	and show session 1 or 2

- print Module diolog box	 to choose

== Note ==
----------------
	when you program
	make the function with a good name then start to implement it
	like: check if configuration_changed(session_id):

	write good tests like the ones in the configuration which show errors

	watch how people use the application
       to find out how you can make the application UX better

						semester + promo + branch + school + teacher
