== QUESTIONS ==
---------------
- Rattrapage printables
- doublage ????
- 

== Note ==
----------------
	when you program
		make the function with a good name then start to implement it
		like: check if configuration_changed(session_id):

	write good tests like the ones in the configuration which show errors

	watch how people use the application
       to find out how you can make the application UX better

	Write things you Note missing in the App


==BREADCRUMBS to finish==
-------------------------
- some breadcrumbs got messed up
	because i moved them
- some breadcrumbs need to adapt to path
	like justification in Grade & resultat
		or just change them to Printables


== PRIORITY 1 ==
----------------
			- add Session Config
			- maybe i should not create RATT from annual when SF
			- check the Observation (SF)
			- how to add new nodes in Config Tree
			- make a warrning in Annual of not filled fields
			- why i can't delete rattrapage in SF
			- move annual calcul to model "annual grade" and "annual session"

			- print of classement (annual and semestrielle)
- flask static
	and upload automaticaly to github
	try to include the javascript
- add printing time to printables
- SF-2017-10 boukhani lalla  2eme annee
	give her 60
	finish     units_fond_aquired for ratt
- in show rattrapage Button show how many Student 
- maybe when i reintialize the ids change
- in reinitialize_session
	uncomment calculate all
- in GradeUnit what is the purpose of unit_coefficient
	used in init_grade_unit --- grade_unit.unit_coefficient = unit.unit_coefficient
	& is_fondamental
		i think i added them for Historic Config
- print bultin is showing None in birth date
- one PDF contains all Semester
- one PDF contains all Annual
- in Student Grid
	show final Average and Credit
	in real time
	when you save show the result
	show annual in students View
- add sort to annual
- add sorter in UEF unit
- indecate the need to calculate in Annual
- when i duplicate the Semester
	is the Modules duplicated too ??????
		yes modules are duplicated
		and this causes problems
			i have to treet Config as a String
- duplicate Semester from FlaskAdmin


- upload files to a free Static website
- when i don't fill Rattrapage
	and then calculate annual - some inconsistencies appear
- in get_annual_chain_students_to_enter_rattrapage_annual
	students list must return from before rattraage
- lock annual



= Session
	- show session in resultat Semester
	- semester Result Ratt must show Session
	- in Result and Bultin 
		be carefull of the source of the data (semester vs ratt)
	- remove session from Annual

== FINISH PRINTABLES
	- classement in resultat
	- finish the 3 printables first
		bultin header + annual + ratt
		and the choice between the two sessions
		print From Annual Page
		and module header
	- Bultin Semester Header
	- Bultin Average & credit & session

== make the navigation easier
	show Semester Average & Annual Average
	between semesters
	from semester result to Module Grid
	from annual to grids
	and from ratt
	and the notion of URL_RETURN
		you can add a flash of url_return

== Refactoring
	- move annual functions from Semester to Annual
		like get_annual_chain
	- in FORM SelectField should filter 
	- when you transfer students to the next year
		they have to qualify
		transfaire from annual, not from semester
		Only Admit & Admit avec dette
