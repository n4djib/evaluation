== QUESTIONS: 
	- what about the students who need to pass some modules (avec dette)




== Progrission et Classement ==
	- Average and credit in Classement is shown in Bultin and Annual like Decision
	- in Promo decide wich Classement and Progression formula
	- in classement-laurieate
		give the option to consider saved students as rattrapage
	- when you transfer students to the next year
		they have to qualify
		transfaire from annual, not from semester
		Only Admit & Admit avec dette




== Potential Bugs ==
	- WARNING: if SF average is under 10 in a semester 
		that does not mean necisseraly it will enter RATT.
		because the Annual saved it
	- WARNING:
		when i duplicate the Semester
		is the Modules duplicated too ??????
			yes modules are duplicated
			and this causes problems
				i have to treat Config as a String
	- WARNING: add/remove Student order in Chrome




== Result ==
	- Note: i am grabing Semester Result Informations from the Config String
	- Semester Result add the option to close module width
		??????????
	- in Result Be carful of long Module Names




== Tree ==
	- add create new branch and school and promo
		and add url_return to go back to tree after creation
	- in Tree check annual session need to caclulate
	- add create annual link to tree
	- use tabs to organize tree each school




== ANNUAL ==
    - classement (by average) in annual
	- lock annual
		maybe no need because you calculate all the time
		and maybe lock it to not allow recalculating 
	- add sort to annual
	- add some colors to annual
	- in ratt annual indicate students who entered the rattrapage
		at least one module
		who is already generated and who is not




== Student ==
	- Student card Matricule (2018/05)
		add a new Field or make it uniform with it
	- finish the Students Filter
		by Branch and Promo
	- add pagination to student table
	- massive students delete Or Branch change
		apply a thing a mass of students	
	- New Inserted students should be given username="*****"
		then you change them with massive Edit
	- massive Students Edit (grid) for a promo
		/*
		  get all usernames
		  get usernames in this Promo
		  do not color the usernames of this Promos
		    unless there is A duplication
		*/
	- deactivate a student rather than deleting him
	- make Choice(Select) Empty in insert many Students
		and don't allow submition
	- add group to student session
	order by group
	teacher by group
	- use tabs to organize students
		in students List
	- Submit Data by CRTL+S in Update many & create many
	- in add/remove Student - Gliphcon Not appearig when internet is Off




== make the navigation easier ==
	- navigate between semesters
	- add a button to navigate between a session(semester) and its ratt
	and the notion of URL_RETURN
		you can add a flash of url_return




== PRINTABLES ==
	- a location to print all Printables
	- all Printables in one PDF of a Session | Annual | Promo 
		for all or for one Student
	- one PDF contains all Annual Printables
	- one PDF contains all Semester Printables
	- add Print: 
		list of rattrapage students without modules to pass
		Ratt list by module
				- add last_modification to printables
					last entry in the database tables Grade
	- add Thumbnail to Preview print
	- print Zerbia (Ratt + normal)
		and show session 1 or 2
	- add diolog box to print Module to choose
	- annual Ratt print must show only when there is two semesters
	- finish Progression Etat





== Refactoring ==
	- move annual functions from Semester to Annual
		like get_annual_chain
	- use Count() in sqlalchemy
	- globlize the changing lists like 
			['cour', 'td', 'tp', 't_pers', 'stage', 'saving_grade']
		to avoid changing them in many places
	- REFACTORING: turn all calculation to calcule by student
		session.calculate() -> session.student_sessions.calculate
	- make check_grid_status() universal in routesSession.py
		pass grades and check them
	- change table names
		student_session --> grade_semester




== GRID ==
	- warning of leaving the grid without save
	- use letters to navigate the grid rather than arrows
	- IDEA: in grade grid
		when you change set to dirty and send only dirty fields
			this will allow parallel editing
	- add double saisier notion
		meaning two agents enter data twice to make sure everything is correct
		maybe no need for it if the student can check by himself
	- autosave Grid by user
	- GRID:
		make grid Save And Fetch Data from Server at the same time
			to allow parrallel editing
	-




== Promo ==
	- show errors in Promo Form
	- init date in Promo
		change the date of the session
	- when creating a new session
		set starting date based on Promo
		when changing the start_date in Promo
    - form error messages in quickform is different than you use the fields
		like in Promo
	- in Basic Table Promos group by School/Branch
	- enforce Promo naming
