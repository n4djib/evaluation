table (grid) group by
http://jsfiddle.net/byv2pk24/89/

						FIX: the values in the grid are not formated 

						put formula in Grade Table
						fix reinitialize


		
		
		
		
						when you choose "all" in grade
							maybe show the formula too


						Changes will be autosaved
						Changes will not be autosaved ----- at start

						when dirty shake the message "Changes will ...."


						calculate UNITE	

fix flash messages in session 
	when calculating and initializing


when reinitializing i must remove the records	
	and when removing the students


						move some of the function in calculation to te modules	
							like get_cumul_



save config in Session
	when reinitialize check if anything changed in the config


add the rest of the values in the Config save



****************
change table names
	unites --> unit
	student_session --> grade_semester

initializition
	put config in session
	put 
	
	
change "formula" in grade to "fields"
	you can't because i need it to calculate average and credit in the grid
	but you can remove Coeff


start by changing
	unite -> unit
	in the code and leave the Model names


maybe remove table Type
